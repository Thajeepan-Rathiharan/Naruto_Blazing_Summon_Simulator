# Naruto Blazing Simulator
This is my small project where I made a pack opening simulator with characters from the mobile game Naruto Ultimate Ninja Blazing. I tried to make this as realistic to the game as possible, hence why you won't always be able to pull the best units straight away.

## Languages used to create this:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Please note that not all characters are in the pool, as this is just a small project, but I may come back to it here and there, and add more characters to it.
